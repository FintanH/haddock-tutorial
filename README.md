# haddock-tutorial

I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@fintan.halpenny/fishy-documentation-c1b47f43bf62) to demonstrate how to use some features from Haddock. This is the accompanying repo. I hope to add more to it and write another follow up post about stuff I missed.

To generate the Haddock documentation you can run: `stack haddock`.

To run the `doctest` test suite for the example usages and property test you can run: `stack test`.
